Docker Scripts
--------------

This is a collection of scripts which simplify working with docker.
This is somewhat redundant with `docker-machine`, but helps when working with manually
configured hosts.

* `docker-env` : allows managing docker hosts in a way similar to docker-machine.
* `docker-certs` : allows generating SSL certificates for securing docker daemon.
* `docker-copy-images` : allows bulk copying images from one registry to another.
* `kubectx-delete` : allows to remove a cluster/context from the kube config file.
* `kubectx-import` : allows to import the kube config from a remote kubernetes host (via SSH).

## Installation

	```
	macoS:~$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
